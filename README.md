# Video_Captioning
Hello!

I'm a computer science and artificial intelligence double major and a neuroscience minor at Drake University. 

When looking for a personal project I wanted to create a program that was a solution to a problem and applicable to my life. I thought of this project when I was working as a social media editor for the Peoria, Illinois Park District. 

When editing videos, it is good practice to add captions to the screen to make the video fast, engaging, and accessible to a large audience. However, this takes a long time to type out each word in a video, and other existing services such as CapCut's transcriber are largely inaccurate. 

In order to create my own program, I divided the task into three parts. The first was to separate the audio from the video using moviepy.editor and tkinter.filedialog (locating the file). Next, this audio file is sent to the Assembly AI transcription servers which returns a python dictionary containing the data for the words in the video and their start and end times. These pieces of data are then overlayed on the original video after the user specifies the font. Also, I added new fonts for stylistic social media editing including albas for a smooth/fun font, proximanova for a classic social media optimized font, and orange_juice for an aesthetic look.

Throughout the creation of this project I learned a lot about using API's, new modules such as moviepy and tkinter, and I was able to experiment with the new and growing field of AI. Along with these features I strongly developed my skills in troubleshooting new programs, breaking problems into smaller goals, and utilizing python documentation of modules. 

Thank you for checking out my projects! I have so many more ideas!
